# Othyn's dotfiles

My configuration. Not so minimalist... but lots of customisation to really make the machine mine. I daily macOS, so I can only guarantee they'll work on a macOS, but I don't see why some of them wouldn't work on Linux.

You may also be interested in my version of the [Mac Development Ansible Playbook](https://github.com/othyn/mac-dev-playbook) repo by [Jeff Geerling](https://github.com/geerlingguy), which configures a Mac just how I like it from scratch using Ansible, and incorporates the installation and updating of a set of dotfiles like this one.
